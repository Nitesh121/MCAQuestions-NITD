<p>c) List two major problems with processing update operations expressed in terms of views.   </p>
<p> d)List two reasons why null values might be introduced into the database. </p>

<p> (e) The outer-join operations extend the natural join operation of the the tuples from the participating relations are not lost in the results that join. Describe how the theta join operations can be extended so of a tuples from the left, right, or both relations are not lost from the results theta join.   2+2+2+2+6  </p>

<p>3. a) Suppose that we have a relation marks (student-id, score) we wish to assign grades to students based on the score as follows: grade F if score< 40, grade p if 40 <= score< 50, grade D if 50 <= grade<60,grade C if< =60  score<70, grade B if 70 <= score 80, grade A 80<= 90 ,ex if<=90 score. write SQL queries of the following.  </p>
