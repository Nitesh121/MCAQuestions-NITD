<h3>Answer All  Questions</h3>
<p>GROUP-A</p>

<p>  1. We assume that the maximum window size is initially 28 segments. The threshold is initially set to 14 segments. When RTT- 8 the timer times out. At RTT 14, 3ACKs are received. Show the RTT vs. CWND diagram.</p>
 <p>   2. Host A is sending data to host B over a full duplex link. A and B are using sliding window protocol for flow control. Distance between And B is 2 km. Data packets (sent only from A to B) are all 1000 bytes long and data rate of network 20 is Mbps. Acknowledgement packets are very small and require very negligible transmission time but maybe there is a propagation time of acknowledgement packet. Speed of velocity (v) is 2x108 m/s. What is the maximum achievable throughput in this communication?</p>
<p>    3. (a) A 8-bit binary value 11101011 is to be encoded using an even-parity Hamming code. What is the binary value after encoding?</p>
<p>    (b) A bit stream 1110101 l is transmitted using the standard CRC method e generator polynomial is x show the actual bit string transmitted. Suppose the third bit from the left is inverted during transmission. Show that this error is detected at the receiver's end. 10x3 </p>
<p>    Group B </p>
    <p>(Answer any seven) 7x4 </p>
   <p> 1. Why network software is organized as a series of layer?</p>
 <p>   2. Why receiver processes in TCP always avoid shrinking phase?</p>
<p>
    4. Why Passive Attack is difficult to detect compared to Active Attack?</p>
   <p> 5. Why digital signature is difficult to forging?</p>
   <p> 6. Why performance Throughput is degrading when load capacity?</p>
   <p>7. "Multicasting IP address resolves some problem of uncasing IP mechanism justify your answer.?</p>
    <p>8. How congestion is reduced in flooding?</p>
   <p> Group C (Answer any one) </p>
  <p>  1. (a) What is replay attack?</p>
    <p>(b) Describe Data Encryption Standards Expansion function and why is it required ?</p>
   <p> (c) Why hash function is required in digital signature 2+6+4 12?</p>
    <p>2. When TCP protocol is set RST and FIN flag? What is fast retransmission? Why intra routing protocol cannot use in inter routing mechanism Describe Split horizon method. 3+2+3+4 12

    <h3>Answer Any five Questions</h3>
    <p>GROUP-A</p>

      <p>  1. (a) Define Memory less property for a random variable. Give example.</p>
        <p>(b) Suppose that the amount of time that a light bulb works before, burning itself out is exponentially distributed with mean ten hours. Suppose that a person enters a room in which a light bulb is burning. If this person desires to work for five hours, then what is the probability that she will be able to complete her work without the bulb burning out?</p>
       <p> c) For an M/M/1 queuing system, prove that L, the average number of customers in the system is equal to A-u, where and refer to the rate of arrival into and rate of departure from the system, respectively.</p>
       <p>  d)Suppose that customers arrive at a Poisson rate of one per every 12 minutes, and that the service time is exponential at a of one service per 8 minutes. Find the average number of customers in the system and their average waiting time in the system.  3+4+4+4</p>

       <p> 2. (a) Prove throughput of stop and wait protocol is X B. where B is the bandwidth,</p>
